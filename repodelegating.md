# Subtree vs Submodule: A Maintainer's Perspective on Sharing Prompts Between Teams

## Introduction

When sharing AI prompts between teams using Git, you have two primary options: **git subtree** and **git submodule**. While both solve the problem of code sharing, they create very different workflows for maintainers who wear multiple hats - contributing to both the central prompt repository and maintaining dependent projects.

This article focuses on the **maintainer's experience** and the trade-offs between convenience of contribution vs. convenience of updates.

## The Dual-Role Challenge

Many developers find themselves in a dual role:
1. **Central Repository Contributor**: Adding/modifying prompts in the shared repository
2. **Dependent Repository Maintainer**: Using those prompts in specific projects

Each approach handles this dual workflow differently, creating distinct advantages and pain points.

## Submodules: Easy Push, Manual Update

### The Contributor Experience (Easy)
With submodules, contributing to the central repository is straightforward:

```bash
# Inside the submodule directory
cd prompts/
echo "New prompt content" > new-prompt.md
git add new-prompt.md
git commit -m "Add new prompt"
git push origin main
```

**✅ Advantage**: Direct push to central repository - no special commands needed.

### The Maintainer Experience (Manual)
However, updating the dependent repository requires explicit "rewiring":

```bash
# Back in the parent repository
cd ../
git add prompts  # Stage the submodule pointer update
git commit -m "Update prompts to latest version"
git push origin main
```

**⚠️ Challenge**: You must manually update the submodule pointer in the dependent repository.

### Submodule Workflow Summary
```
Contribution:  Simple ✅
Updates:       Manual ⚠️
Mental Model:  Two separate repositories that need coordination
```

## Subtrees: Complex Push, Automatic Update

### The Contributor Experience (Complex)
Contributing back to the central repository requires subtree-specific commands:

```bash
# From the parent repository root
git subtree push --prefix=prompts prompts-upstream main
```

**⚠️ Challenge**: Must remember and use subtree-specific push commands.

### The Maintainer Experience (Automatic)
However, updates to the dependent repository are seamless:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=prompts prompts-upstream main
```

**✅ Advantage**: Changes are automatically integrated into your project's history.

### Subtree Workflow Summary
```
Contribution:  Complex ⚠️
Updates:       Automatic ✅
Mental Model:  Single repository with shared history
```

## Decision Matrix for Prompt Sharing

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **High contribution frequency** | Submodules | Easier to push changes to central repo |
| **High update frequency** | Subtrees | Automatic integration reduces friction |
| **Mixed team (some contribute, some consume)** | Submodules | Contributors aren't burdened by complex commands |
| **Single maintainer managing both** | Subtrees | Unified history and simpler mental model |
| **Strict version control needed** | Submodules | Explicit version pinning |
| **Continuous integration preferred** | Subtrees | Changes flow automatically |

## Real-World Considerations

### Team Dynamics
- **Large teams**: Submodules prevent accidental complex operations
- **Small teams**: Subtrees reduce coordination overhead
- **Mixed skill levels**: Submodules have simpler contribution workflow

### Prompt Evolution Patterns
- **Stable prompts**: Submodules work well with explicit versioning
- **Rapidly evolving prompts**: Subtrees reduce update friction
- **Experimental prompts**: Subtrees allow easier rollback via git history

### Repository Hygiene
- **Submodules**: Clean separation, but requires discipline in updates
- **Subtrees**: Merged history, but can become cluttered over time

## Practical Recommendations

### Choose Submodules When:
- Multiple team members frequently contribute to prompts
- You need explicit control over which prompt versions are used
- Your team prefers clear separation between repositories
- Contributors shouldn't need to learn subtree commands

### Choose Subtrees When:
- You're primarily a consumer with occasional contributions
- You want prompt updates to flow automatically
- You prefer unified git history
- You're comfortable with slightly more complex contribution workflow

## Example Workflows

### Submodule Workflow for Prompt Teams
```bash
# Contributing (simple)
cd prompts/
git add new-prompt.md
git commit -m "Add customer service prompt"
git push

# Updating dependent repo (explicit)
cd ../
git submodule update --remote
git add prompts
git commit -m "Update to latest prompts"
git push
```

### Subtree Workflow for Prompt Teams
```bash
# Contributing (requires specific command)
git add prompts/new-prompt.md
git commit -m "Add customer service prompt"
git subtree push --prefix=prompts upstream main

# Updating dependent repo (automatic)
git subtree pull --prefix=prompts upstream main
```

## Conclusion

The choice between subtrees and submodules for sharing prompts isn't just technical—it's about workflow efficiency for your specific team dynamics.

**If your team frequently contributes to the central prompt repository**, submodules provide a more intuitive contribution experience at the cost of manual update coordination.

**If your team primarily consumes prompts with occasional contributions**, subtrees offer automatic integration at the cost of learning specialized push commands.

Consider your team's contribution patterns, technical comfort level, and desired level of automation when making this decision. Both approaches work well for prompt sharing—the key is choosing the one that matches your team's workflow preferences.

## What's Your Experience?

I'm personally leaning toward git submodules for my future projects, but I'd love to hear your perspective!
